# College-Football-Python
Data Analysis portfolio project. Uncovering insights on college football recruiting in python and tableau.
# Project Overview
The popular saying “football is more about the Jimmy’s and Joe’s than the X’s and O’s” has long been a
discussion in college football. Many people believe a good head coach or elite coordinators can consistently
propel a team to high win totals and championships. This project aims to understand the impact high school
recruiting has on a college team. One way to measure recruiting success is with the blue-chip ratio, the 
number of 4 and 5 star recruits divided by total number of recruits. This blue-chip ratio will be used to 
understand the level or recruiting needed to achieve a high win total.

This project will focus on team win totals and offense and defense ratings relative to team recruiting 
success. Recruiting success can be based on a number of factors including the blue-chip ratio, elite talent 
in high performance positions (Quarterback, Edge, and WR), and in-state recruiting to mention a few. 

This project uses the recruiting years from 2018 until the third quarter of 2023 although the college team 
statistics will cover the NCAA season starting in 2017 through 2022 as the 2023 season has yet to finish. In 
order to be successful in this project we will have to assume college football teams each individually recruit 
at a relatively static level over time. 

## Tools & Skills
Tableau

Python Version: 3.11
Packages: pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, seaborn, folium, json, sklearn, pylab, statsmodels
* Executed data wrangling and cleaning operations prior to analysis.
* Conducted geospatial analysis using a shapefile to create a choropleth map.
* Performed linear regression analysis and analyzed model performance statistics.
* Used elbow technique to prepare data for cluster analysis using k-means algorithm.
* Tested data for stationarity using Dickey-Fuller test and autocorrelation plots.
* Differenced data to ensure stationarity before conducting time-series analysis.

## Purpose & Context
I independently sourced relevant and reliable datasets to uncover insights on college football including which regions and states have the most highschool talent, and what regions and schools recruit the most talent. As well as make recommendations on which positions are most valueable and command the most resources.
